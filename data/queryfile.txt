<title> Topic: Control of Food Supplements 

<desc> Description: 
Should the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exercise 
more stringent control over the labelling and sale of 
food supplements.

<narr> Narrative: 
Food supplements include vitamins, herbal preparations, 
minerals and amino acids.  It is estimated that nearly 
half of all Americans take some dietary supplement every day.  
Until recent years there has been little concern that there 
has been no federal rules covering this four billion dollar 
a year industry.  The government has become concerned with the 
purity of the products, and points to deaths and injuries which 
have occurred because of the contamination of certain 
supplements.  The government is also concerned about 
the exaggerated claims made for some products, and the 
lack of warning labels on the products.  Those who take 
the opposite side of the argument say that the FDA wants 
to eventually control supplements as if they were drugs.
Any item which addresses either side of the argument would be
relevant.

lose weight at any one time, according to a report by the NIH.  
Evidence presented at an NIH Conference showed that diets 
fail the majority of time.  Some therapists believe that 
overweight people need to learn to accept themselves, forget

security relating in particular to additional
steps taken by airports to increase flight safety

security does not constitute relevance.  Additional
steps refer to something beyond just passenger
and carry-on screening using the normal methods.
Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, 
sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, 
and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the 
baggage compartment.
